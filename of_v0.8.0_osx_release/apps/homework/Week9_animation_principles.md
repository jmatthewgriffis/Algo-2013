YouTube video examples of six of the 12 Principles of Animation

1. Squash and Stretch

This is not animation but it's certainly a spectacular example of how squash and stretch relate to real behavior. Bonus points for particle system and this also embodies Anticipation (maybe in a different sense) with the incredible slow opening.

2. Anticipation

Speaking of Anticipation, there's a great example at the 3-minute mark when he runs offscreen.

3. Timing

This clip from the amazing Cowboy Bebop shows off Staging really well in the dramatic camera angles and unexpected areas of focus, as well as Followthrough / Overlapping Action with the way their hair moves, but if I had to pick one principle it would be Timing, for making the fight feel believable, not to mention the touches in his escape like how he hangs in the air for a moment when he leaps off the bridge (not so realistic but very interesting).

4. Appeal

Come on, do I really have to explain this? You can see it in the first 6 seconds. Look at those adorable sad robotic eyes! Look at how he anthropomorphically "sighs." Gold. (Now I need to watch the movie again.)

5. Staging

This incredible sequence from Samurai Jack uses light and shadow in a genius way narratively but it also keeps the focus and play of the battle very pure and simple--just beams of black or white, yet it somehow conveys the necessary physicality.

6. Exaggeration

This assignment is really just an excuse to revisit my favorite animation...anyway, all the movement in this movie is slightly (or less slightly) exaggerated to make it more interesting, like how big the little sister's smile gets. There's also just a genuine weight to everything, and also Miyazaki is the best.
